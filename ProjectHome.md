This plugin creates IdaPro-like function graphs. The graphs contain hit trace information. If you have DiffSnake installed the hit trace info is color coded like DiffSnake

OllyTraceGraph is a modification of OllyGraph by Austyn Krutsinger

Thanks for providing the source, Austyn!

Changes:

1. Display hit trace information in the graph

2. Compatibility with DiffSnake (hit trace info is color coded)

3. newer wingraph executable, qwingraph.exe

4. compatibility with aisee 3 (prettier graphs) and similar programs.

5. cosmetic improvements for graph display (especially when using aisee 3)


Usage: Just put OllyTraceGraph.dll, QtCore4.dll, QtGui4.dll and qwingraph.exe into your olly plugins directory. Right-click on a piece of analyzed code and select the OllyTraceGraph plugin.
