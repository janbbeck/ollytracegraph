This plugin creates IdaPro-like function graphs. The graphs contain hit trace information. If you have DiffSnake installed the hit trace info is color coded like DiffSnake.

OllyTraceGraph is a modification of OllyGraph by Austyn Krutsinger. Thanks for providing the source, Austyn!

Changes over OllyGraph:

1. Display hit trace information in the graph
2. Compatibility with DiffSnake (hit trace info is color coded the same way DiffTrace codes the trace in the CPU window)
3. newer wingraph executable, qwingraph.exe (old wingraph.exe still works)
4. compatibility with aisee 3 (prettier graphs) and similar programs.
5. cosmetic improvements for graph display (especially when using aisee 3)

Usage: Just put OllyTraceGraph.dll, QtCore4.dll, QtGui4.dll and qwingraph.exe into your olly plugins directory. Right-click on a piece of analyzed code and select the OllyTraceGraph plugin.
